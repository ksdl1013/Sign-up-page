This is a sample website which depicts the frontend of a signup page.
I made use of flex-box, transitions, transformations and various other CSS features in building the website.
The file consists of HTML file which has the basic structure of the website, CSS file which has all the styles used while building the website.
In addition to this, there is a Javascript file which makes the page somewhat responsive.
